# JSON Prompt

Expand on this list with more popular / classic area codes. You can also refine/improve existing ones.

I want each area code to have 3 messages. The messages are pretend text messages that give a hint about the place.

- Each record should have a mix of questions and statements.
- The tone should be casual, and use texting syntax like "l8r" and "omg"
- Each message should reference something specific about that place (look at both city and state).
- It could also reference pop culture, food, landmarks, slang, tv shows, sports teams, etc.
- Avoid actually naming the city or state in the hint messages

Example question: "Do you wanna grab some deep dish pizza 2nite?" -> (Chicago)
Example statement: "omg, I think I just saw brad pitt at my coffee shop" -> (LA)
